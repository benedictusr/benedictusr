Hi guys! 👋
My name is Benedictus Ramanda Putra (@benedictusr)
You can call me Bene 😁

Basically I have a banchelor's degree in Electrical Engineering ⚡⚡, but...
I love coding a lot 🤣

I started my coding journey by learning C++
this helped me a lot while I was working on the final project
as one of the requirements to finish my degree.
My final project is Early Landslide Detection using Arduino!

After that, I started learning Python 🐍
by taking bootcamps on Udemy.
I have some projects that you can see in my repository (later).

And now I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript
I'm about to become a web developer 😁
I hope you guys can help me be a better coder hehe...
